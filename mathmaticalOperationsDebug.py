40 * 0 = 0                  zero times anything is zero 

"Hello 1 2 and" + 3         cant't add strings with int.

6 * 5 + 1 = 31              six times five is thirty and plus one is thirty one

print(10 / 2)               remove quotes

print("lol" * 3)            it's fine

print( "1" + "2" + "3")     lowercase P in the print

10 % 2 == 0                 2 goes into 10 evenly so 0 is trhe remainder
